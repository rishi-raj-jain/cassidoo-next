I first discovered the author [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/) when he launched a Kickstarter in the pandemic, where he announced that he wrote 4 books. It felt like everyone on Reddit and Discord and TikTok were raving about how he's the most productive author ever, and he's so fun, blah blah.

So, I backed the Kickstarter, thinking I might try this author, not knowing anything about his other books and his whole "Cosmere" universe where multiple stories exist. A few friends on Discord told me which books I should try reading before getting the Kickstarter books, and I picked up the [Mistborn Trilogy](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-mistborn-saga-the-original-trilogy/).

As a side note... I'd been reading a whole lot of non-fiction. Tons of productivity books and books about the world as we know it, management books, science books, those sorts of things.

But y'all, I haven't loved reading fantasy this much since I read Harry Potter or the Hunger Games! I used to **love** fantasy adventure books when I was younger, and I somehow lost that, but these books have brought me back. The Mistborn Trilogy had me hooked from the start, and I'm more than halfway through those 4 Kickstarter books as well (I've read The Frugal Wizard's Handbook For Surviving Medieval England and Tress of the Emerald Sea so far, and I'm reading The Sunlit Man now). I'm truly having a blast. The stories are such genuinely wonderful, wholesome, exciting adventures that I haven't experienced in so long!

I am very happy to put aside the non-fiction for a while. I've enjoyed reading so much more these days, and getting immersed in the stories of Brando Sando is absolutely the reason why.
